### ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hospital_Management_System.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**

    ```bash
    cd Hospital_Management_System/backend
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:

    ```env
    DB_USER=yourdbuser
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_NAME=databasename
    DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
    DB_PORT=portno
    ```

    - `DB_USER`   : Your PostgreSQL username  
    - `DB_HOST`   : Typically `localhost`  
    - `DB_NAME`   : The name of your database  
    - `DB_PASSWORD` : Your PostgreSQL password  
    - `DB_PORT`   : Default is usually `5432`

4. **Install Dependencies**

    Run the following command to install all Node.js dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. **Start the Server**

    Run the server using `nodemon`:

    ```bash
    nodemon index.js
    ```

    > If `nodemon` is not installed globally, you can install it with:
